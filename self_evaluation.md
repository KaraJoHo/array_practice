### I feel good about the Arrays content.

### I need to review the definition and work through some practice so I can familiarize myself with the vocabulary and the different outputs those methods give

### Are there different ways to write the code for methods? It looks like there are multiple ways to call methods. Is ruby pretty flexible, but I assume whatever way we pick is the one we should stick with to keep things neat and consistent
